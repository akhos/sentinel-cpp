# Sentinel-Core: High-Performance File Security Engine

A C++ utility designed to analyze file integrity and detect obfuscated malware through entropy analysis.

## 🚀 Features
- **Binary Analysis:** Deep-reads raw file bytes using C++ binary streams.
- **Entropy Scoring:** Uses Shannon Entropy logic to detect encrypted payloads.
- **Memory Safe:** Built using Modern C++ (20/23) paradigms (RAII, Smart Pointers).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** C++20
- **Libraries:** std::filesystem, STL

## 📈 Roadmap
- [x] Day 1: Basic file metadata extraction and binary reading.
- [ ] Phase 2: Implementation of Shannon Entropy math.
- [ ] Phase 3: ML-based classification (Python integration).# sentinel-cpp
