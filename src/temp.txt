this is a text file 
the purpose of this file is for testing
this file is used to test Sentinel program
The program retrieves the file information 
It also calculates the Shannon Entropy of the file
The shanon entropy lower than 6.0 shows that the file is normal
the shanon entropy between 7.2 to 8.0 shows high chaos in the file
This is "smoking gun" for encrypted data, compressed files or malware
